## About CollapseLoader

CollapseLoader is a free, open-source tool built with Rust and Tauri. It helps you safely launch Minecraft cheat clients on Windows and Linux. We focus on safety, honesty, and making things easy to use.

### Key Features

-   **Strict Checks**: We only support clients that pass our security tests.
-   **Open Source**: Anyone can check our code on [GitHub](https://github.com/dest4590/CollapseLoader).
-   **Works Everywhere**: Runs great on both Windows and Linux.
-   **No Viruses**: We scan every client and update with powerful antivirus tools to make sure they are clean.

## Why CollapseLoader is Safe

We built CollapseLoader with safety in mind:

-   **Public Code**: All parts of our project are on [GitHub](https://github.com/CollapseLoader) for anyone to check.
-   **Tested Clients**: We test each client using special tools and virus scanners to ensure they are safe, using our own [CollapseScanner](https://github.com/CollapseLoader/CollapseScanner) tool.
-   **No Hidden Code**: We do not allow clients with hidden or "obfuscated" code. All clients code are fully open for review.
-   **Automatic Builds**: Our downloads are built automatically by GitHub Actions, so you know the files are safe and unchanged.

> **Note**: Even though we make things as safe as possible, always be careful with cheat clients. Only download from official sources.
