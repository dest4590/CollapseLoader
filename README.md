## About CollapseLoader

CollapseLoader is an open-source GUI utility built with Rust and Tauri to securely launch Minecraft cheat clients on Windows and Linux. It prioritizes safety, transparency, and ease of use.

*   **Open-Source Transparency**: All code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/dest4590/CollapseLoader) for community review.
*   **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on Windows and Linux.
*   **Virus-Free Guarantee**: Every client and build is scanned for malware using advanced tools and VirusTotal.

## Why CollapseLoader is Safe

CollapseLoader is designed with security as a top priority:

*   **Fully Open-Source**: All components (launcher, API, Discord bot) are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/CollapseLoader) for public auditing.
*   **Rigorous Client Verification**: Each client is tested using virtual machines, decompilers, debuggers, and VirusTotal to ensure it’s free of malware.
*   **No Obfuscation**: Clients with protectors like VMProtect or Themida are prohibited, and CollapseLoader’s code is free of obfuscation for full transparency.
*   **Automated Builds**: Built via GitHub Actions, ensuring reproducible and tamper-free releases. Download builds directly from [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/dest4590/CollapseLoader/actions).

> **Note**: While CollapseLoader ensures maximum safety, always exercise caution with cheat clients, as they carry inherent risks. Download only from official sources.
