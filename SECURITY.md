# CollapseLoader: Why It's Safe

### [Russian version](SECURITY-RU.md)

CollapseLoader is a free tool for Minecraft cheat clients. We promise to be completely open and check everything to make sure you are safe.

Our safety plan is based on three simple ideas:

## 1. Everyone Can Check Our Code

*   **Totally Open:** All the code for CollapseLoader is shared online on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/CollapseLoader).
*   **No Secrets:** We have no hidden code, backdoors, or traps.
*   **Community Help:** Smart people can look at our code and tell us if they spot any problems, so we can fix them fast.

## 2. We Check All Cheat Clients for Bad Stuff

We have a strict rule: if a cheat client looks suspicious or tries to hide its code, we reject it.

### Our Secret Weapon: CollapseScanner

We use our program called **CollapseScanner** to look deep inside client files. It helps us find:

*   **Hidden Threats:** Malicious code, RAT, or stealer.
*   **Shady Connections:** Attempts to connect to ips, no-name websites and webhooks.
*   **Hidden Code:** Any code that has been obfuscated (strings, .class file remap) to try and hide what it does. **We automatically reject any client that hides its code.**

### The Checkup Process

Every cheat client we list goes through a full safety check:
*   **Deep Scan:** Checked by **CollapseScanner**.
*   **Safety Test:** Tested in a safe, isolated environment.
*   **Manual Look:** A person looks at the code for anything strange.
*   
## 3. We Guarantee the File You Get is the Real One

*   **Automatic Building:** We use the **GitHub Actions** service to automatically create the final program file. This removes any human involvement.
*   **No Tampering:** This guarantees that the final file you download exactly matches the public code—no one can sneak a virus into the download link.

## Your Safety Tips

Even with all our safety checks, using any third-party cheat client has risks. Protect yourself by following these steps:

*   **Only Use Official Downloads:** Always get CollapseLoader from our official [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/CollapseLoader) or [collapseloader.org](https://collapseloader.org).
*   **Stay Updated:** Always use the newest version of CollapseLoader to get the latest fixes and features.
