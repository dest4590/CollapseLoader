CollapseLoader is a free tool for Minecraft cheat clients. We are 100% open and check everything to keep you safe.

Our safety plan has three simple parts:

## 1. Everyone Can See Our Code

-   **Fully Open Source:** All the code for CollapseLoader is on our [GitHub organization](https://github.com/CollapseLoader).
-   **No Secrets:** We have no hidden tricks, backdoors, or harmful code.
-   **Community Checks:** People can look at our code to make sure it is safe.

## 2. We Check Clients for Viruses

We have a strict rule: **if a client looks unsafe or tries to hide its code (obfuscation), we do not add it.**

### Our Tool: CollapseScanner

We use a special tool called **CollapseScanner** to check files. It finds:

-   **Viruses:** Any bad software or malware.
-   **Bad Connections:** Attempts to connect to strange websites or collecting data.
-   **Hidden Code:** Code that is obfuscated to hide what it does. **We reject any client that tries to hide its code.**

## 3. Safe Downloads

-   **Built Automatically:** We use **GitHub Actions** to build the program. This means no one can secretly change the code.
-   **No Tricks:** The file you download matches our code exactly. No one can secretly add a virus to the download link.

-   **Official Sources:** Only download from our [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/CollapseLoader) or [collapseloader.org](https://collapseloader.org).
-   **Update Often:** Always use the latest version for the best safety.
